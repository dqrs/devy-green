# devY Red Pokemon Trainer

The devY Red Pokemon Trainer app is a web application that was built to accompany the live devY Red Javascript course taught at [9 Dots Community Learning Center](http://9dots.org) over the [summer](http://www.9dots.org/summer/) of 2016. It's designed for middle school students with little to no prior programming experience. The course focuses on variables, functions, conditionals, and the basics of object-oriented programming. It also includes some exercises covering arrays and for-loops.

## Usage

### 1. Writing Code
The course starts in a code editor (in this case Cloud9's Ace Editor), where students are given a technical specification describing a variable, function, or method required by the app.

### 2. Executing Code in the App Interface
The student can then execute her implementation by clicking the corresponding 'code tag,' which gives the student a description of the Javascript expression that should be entered.

### 3. Syntax Validation
The student's Javascript expression is validated against the expected expression for that code tag. The code is only executed if the expression is entered correctly.

### 4. Testing
Then unit tests are run on the code verifying its correctness, with partial credit given for each test passed.

### 5. Code Activation
Finally, the code is 'activated' by the app, visualizing the end-result of the executed expression.

## Live Demo
To access a live demo, please go to the following Cloud9 Workspace: https://ide.c9.io/devytest/devy-red-demo. Login with username: **devytest** and password: **devytest123**

(Note: a github account is needed to login and save your progress through the course.)

Once in the devY Red Demo workspace, look for the file tree on the left-hand side. Right-click on "trainer.html" and select "Preview." This will generate a live-reloadable instance of the application linked to the javascript files in "js" folder. 

Then open up "app.js" to begin the course. You'll find some basic documentation about the built-in API that the app expects you to use in "docs/api-documentation.txt". Once you've finished the exercises in "app.js", move on to "trainer.js"
